## KMP & CMP
Kotlin Multiplatform is a Jetbrains technology that allows you to write a single codebase & use it among multiple platforms such as Android, IOS, desktop, etc.
Similarly, compose multiplatform allows us to share UI among all the devices written using Jetpack Compose.

## Ktor & Koin
* In this project, Ktor was used for handling API calls. It supports cross platform development. Ktor is similar to Retrofit but written purely in Kotlin.
* Koin is a dependency injection library which also supports cross platform.

## Architecture
This application follows MVI android architecture where the app is structured into many packages according to the features.
MVI is a popular architecture which stands for Model-View-Intent

## Coil
This library was used for loading images asynchronously. These images are automatically cached to the device & instantly loaded whenever needed.

## Sources/References
I have been working on this app for a while now. This is sort of my first fully functional KMP project & I followed Philipp Lackner's tutorial for this. Link -https://youtu.be/WT9-4DXUqsM
